# GPUIX

React bindings for [GPUI](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/tree/main/crates/gpui) - Zed's GPU-accelerated UI framework.

Build native GPU-accelerated desktop apps with React and TypeScript. Your components render directly to the GPU via Metal, DirectX, or Vulkan. No Electron, no web views.

![The GPUIX chat example running natively](./docs/images/chat-app.png)

Everything above is GPUIX: the sidebar, the scrolling list, the composer,
and native `<markdown>`. Start it with **`bun --hot`** so a save remounts React
on the same window:

```bash
cd examples && bun --hot chat.tsx
```

## Quickstart

Create an app from the official example. The command downloads only
`example-app/` and installs its dependencies. There is no repository clone,
native build, or Rust toolchain.

```bash
bunx @gpuix/cli new my-app
cd my-app
bun run dev
```

`@gpuix/react` pulls the native renderer for your platform. Edit `app.tsx` and
the running window remounts on save. Click and keyboard handlers switch to the
new tree without recreating the window.

### Build from scratch

Install the packages directly when you do not want the example app:

```bash
bun add @gpuix/react react
bun add -d @types/react typescript
```

### 1. Point TypeScript at the GPUIX JSX types

**`jsxImportSource` is required.** Without it TypeScript uses DOM types, so
`<virtual-list>`, `<markdown>`, `<code>` and `style.hover` all fail to
typecheck.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "@gpuix/react",
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "noEmit": true
  }
}
```

### 2. Write the entry file

End the file with `render()`. That call creates the window, mounts React, and
starts the frame loop.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import { render } from '@gpuix/react'

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <div style={{ padding: 24, backgroundColor: '#1a1a1a', height: '100%' }}>
      <div
        onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}
        style={{
          padding: 12,
          borderRadius: 8,
          cursor: 'pointer',
          backgroundColor: '#232323',
          hover: { backgroundColor: '#2c2c2c' },
        }}
      >
        <text style={{ color: '#e2e2e2' }}>Count: {count}</text>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

render(<App />, { title: 'My App', width: 800, height: 600 })
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Give every `<text>` a `color`.** GPUI does not inherit `color` from a
> parent, so text with no color paints **black** and disappears on a dark
> surface.

### 3. Run it

```bash
bun --hot app.tsx
```

Use `bun --hot`, not plain `bun`. A save then remounts React on the same
window instead of opening a second one.

### 4. Ship a binary

```bash
bun build --compile app.tsx --outfile dist/app
./dist/app
```

The binary carries the renderer, so it runs with no Bun and no Node install.

### Start from the example app

[`example-app/`](https://github.com/remorses/gpuix/tree/main/example-app) is a complete todo app in one file, with `dev`,
`build`, `web:dev` and `typecheck` scripts already wired. Create a copy with
`bunx @gpuix/cli new my-app`.

![The GPUIX todo example app](./docs/images/todo-app.png)

### Shell completions

Install completions for the `gpuix` command:

```bash
bun add -g @gpuix/cli
gpuix completions install
```

## Examples

| Example | Run | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| **todo** | `bun run dev` in [`example-app/`](https://github.com/remorses/gpuix/tree/main/example-app) | The starting point: one file, a `<virtual-list>`, a native `<input>`, and an animated sidebar |
| **blurred window** | `bun run blurred-window` | A macOS frosted-glass surface using GPUI's native vibrancy backdrop and transparent titlebar |
| **chat** | `bun --hot chat.tsx` | A GPUIX app: transparent titlebar, animated sidebar, message list, composer, `<markdown>` |
| **timeline** | `bun --hot timeline.tsx` | A video-editor timeline: clip dragging, edge trimming with snapping, playhead scrubbing, marquee selection, zoom under the pointer, and a two-axis pan with a frozen ruler and track column |
| **native-text** | `bun --hot native-text.tsx` | The three native text components with a tab switcher |
| **counter** | `bun --hot counter.tsx` | The smallest possible app: state, events, hover |
| **diff** | `bun --hot diff.tsx` | A diff viewer composed from `<div>` and `<text>` in JS, for comparison |
| **web** | `bun run web` from the repository root | The ChatGPT example rendered in a browser canvas with WebGPU |

The todo app lives in [`example-app/`](https://github.com/remorses/gpuix/tree/main/example-app) and is meant to be copied.
The rest live in [`examples/`](https://github.com/remorses/gpuix/tree/main/examples). All of them use hardcoded data.

Or download a standalone **chat** build from the [GitHub release](https://github.com/remorses/gpuix/releases). No Bun or Rust install is required.

```bash
tar -xzf example-chat-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
./example-chat-aarch64-apple-darwin
```

The archive keeps the executable bit, so there is no `chmod` step. macOS may still block the unsigned binary the first time. Right-click the file, choose **Open**, and confirm.

On Windows, download `example-chat-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` and double-click it. On Linux, the file is `example-chat-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`.

The web example bundles the same React app and reconciler as the desktop chat
example. wasm-bindgen exposes mutations and event callbacks to the existing
retained tree and `GpuixView`, which run through GPUI's browser platform.

The web build needs nightly Rust and the matching wasm-bindgen CLI:

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly --component rust-src --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --version 0.2.127 --locked
bun run web
```

The generated Wasm uses shared memory, so the page must be cross-origin
isolated. Production servers must send these headers on the **top-level
document**:

```http
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

`require-corp` then constrains **cross-origin** subresources, which must supply
their own CORS or `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`. Serve the JavaScript and the
Wasm from the same origin as the document and nothing else is needed.

`bun run web` rebuilds the Wasm only when `packages/native/wasm` is missing.
After a Rust change, force it:

```bash
bun scripts/web.ts --rebuild
```

#### Hot reload in the browser

`bun run web` serves the example through Bun's frontend dev server, so an edit
to `examples/chat.tsx` arrives as a **React Fast Refresh** update. Components
swap in place and `useState` survives, which means the composer text, the
sidebar selection, and the scroll position all stay where they were. The GPUI
canvas is never re-created and the ~19 MB Wasm module is never re-fetched.

Fast Refresh only applies to a module whose exports are all components. Edit
anything else, such as the entry file, and Bun reloads the page instead. Both
paths are correct; the reload is only slower.

The Wasm half is a **singleton and must never re-evaluate**.
`WebGpuixRenderer::init` fails with `GPUIX web is already running` once its
thread-local app exists, and GPUI's browser platform appends its own canvas to
`<body>`. What protects it is not that it lives in `node_modules`; Bun bundles
it into the same client registry as your app. It is that Bun re-runs only the
**changed** module and then walks upward through its importers, so an unchanged
dependency stays evaluated and cached. Two rules follow:

- do not call `import.meta.hot.accept("./your-app", ...)` in the entry file.
  Bun runs an importer's dependency-accept callback **even when the imported
  module already self-accepted**, so that callback would remount the tree on top
  of a successful refresh and throw away every `useState`
- keep the `@gpuix/native` import in a module that can never become a Refresh
  boundary and is never explicitly accepted

The chat example puts a virtualized `<diff>` and a GFM table inside an assistant
turn, inside a scrolling transcript:

![A diff and a markdown table inside a chat turn](./docs/images/chat-diff.png)

Markdown, code and a virtualized diff in one frame:

## Architecture

GPUIX bridges React to GPUI using a **mutation-based protocol**. Desktop apps use napi-rs; browser apps load the same Rust renderer through wasm-bindgen. React collects changed elements into one atomic mutation batch per commit. Rust applies that batch to a retained element tree that GPUI reads each frame.

## Why This Works

GPUI is an **immediate-mode** UI framework — it rebuilds the entire element tree every frame. Instead of fighting this, GPUIX embraces it:

1. React reconciler detects a state change and queues host mutations (`createElement`, `setStyle`, `appendChild`, etc.)
2. `applyBatch()` validates and applies the complete commit to the Rust **RetainedTree**
3. On each GPUI frame, `GpuixView::render()` walks the RetainedTree and calls `build_element()` to produce ephemeral GPUI elements
4. GPUI lays them out (Taffy flexbox) and renders to the GPU
5. Only **changed elements** cross the FFI boundary — React's reconciler diffs the virtual tree and sends minimal mutations

This is the same protocol React uses for the DOM (`createElement`, `appendChild`, `removeChild`, `commitUpdate`), but targeting a GPU renderer instead of a browser.

## Mutation API

The mutation surface between JS and Rust is one atomic method. Desktop uses napi and the browser uses wasm-bindgen:

```ts
interface NativeRenderer {
  applyBatch(json: string): Array<number>
}
```

Element IDs are plain numbers generated by an incrementing counter in JS. React may abandon work in concurrent render mode, so GPUIX keeps new host nodes in JS until React places the accepted subtree during commit. Only then are its mutations added to the batch. `applyBatch()` applies that accepted commit atomically and marks the Rust view dirty for the next frame.

## Event Flow

Events travel from GPUI back to React through a `ThreadsafeFunction` on desktop
and a wasm-bindgen callback in the browser.

```
User clicks element id=3
       │
       ▼
GPUI fires on_click on the element
       │
       ▼
Rust closure calls emit_event_full(callback, 3, "click", {x, y, ...})
       │
       ▼
Desktop ThreadsafeFunction / browser callback sends EventPayload
       │
       ▼
JS event registry: eventHandlers.get(3)?.get("click")?.(payload)
       │
       ▼
React handler runs: onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}
       │
       ▼
State update triggers re-render → reconciler sends mutations back to Rust
```

Event handlers are stored in a JS-side registry keyed by `(elementId, eventType)`. Rust only knows **whether** an element has a listener (via `setEventListener`), not the closure itself — the actual handler lives in JS.

## Packages

- **`@gpuix/native`** — Rust bindings to GPUI. It publishes napi-rs desktop binaries and a wasm-bindgen browser build, both backed by `GpuixRenderer`, `RetainedTree`, `build_element()`, and `apply_styles()`.
- **`@gpuix/react`** — React reconciler, event registry, and TypeScript types. Implements the `react-reconciler` host config using the mutation API.
- **`@gpuix/cli`** — `gpuix new` downloads `example-app/`, sets its published React dependency, and installs it as a standalone project.

## Building

This section is for **working on GPUIX itself**. To build an app with it, see
[Quickstart](#quickstart) instead. Installing the packages needs no Rust
toolchain and no submodule.

### Prerequisites

1. Rust toolchain
2. Node.js 18+
3. Xcode with Metal Toolchain (macOS)

```bash
# Install Metal Toolchain if needed
xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Check out the pinned GPUI fork
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build native package
cd packages/native
bun run build

# Build React package
cd ../react
bun run build

# Run example (use tmux for long-running sessions)
cd ../../examples
bun --hot counter.tsx
```

## Usage

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { render } from '@gpuix/react'

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: 8, padding: 16 }}>
      <div
        style={{ backgroundColor: '#3b82f6', borderRadius: 8, padding: 12, cursor: 'pointer' }}
        onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}
      >
        <div style={{ color: '#ffffff' }}>Count: {count}</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

render(<App />, {
  title: 'My App',
  width: 800,
  height: 600,
  titlebarTransparent: true,
  windowBackground: 'blurred',
  trafficLightX: 16,
  trafficLightY: 17,
})
```

`render()` creates the native window, mounts React, and starts the frame loop.
The red traffic-light button quits the process. Start the app again from the
terminal.

| Option | Values | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `titlebarTransparent` | boolean | Hide the native titlebar so the app draws chrome under the traffic lights |
| `windowBackground` | `"opaque"` (default), `"transparent"`, `"blurred"` | Window fill. `"blurred"` is the macOS vibrancy backdrop |
| `trafficLightX` / `trafficLightY` | pixels | Traffic-light origin. The chat example uses `(16, 17)` |
| `transparent` | boolean | Same as `windowBackground: "transparent"` when that option is unset |
| `appName` | string | Name inside the macOS `Hide X` and `Quit X` items. Defaults to `title` |
| `focus` | boolean, default `true` | `false` opens the window behind the active app, like `open -g` |
| `show` | boolean, default `true` | `false` opens the window hidden. Call `activateWindow()` to reveal it |

Call it again after a save and it remounts the tree on the same window.

### The macOS menu bar

GPUIX installs the application menu bar for you, so a fresh app already answers
`⌘Q`, `⌘H`, `⌥⌘H`, `⌘M`, and `⌘W`. Without it `NSApp.mainMenu` is nil, macOS
paints an empty menu bar, and those shortcuts do not exist at all: AppKit only
provides them through menu items.

```
Apple    <executable>             Window
         ├ Services               ├ (AppKit window tiling)
         ├ Hide <appName>   ⌘H    ├ Minimize          ⌘M
         ├ Hide Others     ⌥⌘H    ├ Zoom
         ├ Show All               ├ Close Window      ⌘W
         └ Quit <appName>   ⌘Q    └ (open windows)
```

**`appName` does not set the title of the application menu.** macOS takes that
from the executable, so `bun app.tsx` shows `bun` during development and a
`bun build --compile` binary shows its own file name. Only a real `.app` bundle
changes it. `appName` reaches the items inside the menu, and nothing else.

There is **no Edit menu**, on purpose. A menu key equivalent is consumed by
AppKit before the window sees the key event, so an Edit menu carrying `⌘C`
would take the keystroke away from text selection and from `<input>`.

Use **`render()`**, not `createRenderer()`, in the app entry. `bun --hot`
re-runs the whole file on save. `createRenderer()` plus `init()` would then
build a second host. `render()` is idempotent: the first call owns the window,
later calls only remount React.

`createRenderer()`, `createRoot()`, and `startFrameLoop()` stay public for
tests and custom hosts. Pass `{ renderer }` into `render()` when you already
have one.

**One renderer drives one root.** A renderer owns one window, one native root
id, and one event map, so `createRoot()` throws if that renderer already has a
mounted root. Call `unmount()` on the first root before you create another;
`render()` already does that for you.

### Background launch

`focus: false` opens the window **without taking focus**. The app you were
typing in keeps the caret and the active titlebar. `show: false` goes further
and opens no window at all, so the process runs with a live React tree and
nothing on screen.

```tsx
render(<App />, { title: 'Notes', focus: false })
```

**Turn this on whenever a coding agent runs your app.** An agent that starts
the app to check its work will otherwise yank the window in front of whatever
you are doing, mid-sentence, once per iteration. With `focus: false` the agent
still gets a real GPU-rendered window it can screenshot and click, and you keep
your editor. See [Let an agent drive the app](#let-an-agent-drive-the-app).

`activateWindow()` brings the window forward and focuses it. It is the only way
to reveal a `show: false` window. Reach it from any component with
`useGpuixRequired()`:

```tsx
import { useGpuixRequired } from '@gpuix/react'

function Reveal() {
  const renderer = useGpuixRequired()
  return <div onClick={() => renderer.activateWindow?.()}>Show</div>
}
```

Outside React, call it on the renderer that `createRenderer()` returned.

| Platform | `focus: false` | `show: false` |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | window orders in front without becoming key, like `open -g` | honored |
| Windows | `SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE` | honored |
| Linux | **ignored**, the window opens focused | **ignored** |

The process still gets a **Dock icon** on macOS. GPUI sets the regular
activation policy, so there is no menu-bar-agent mode yet. For a real
background daemon, run the app from a `launchd` agent in
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/`; launchd never activates the process.

### Let an agent drive the app

Make focus opt-in through the environment, so a human run behaves normally and
an agent run stays out of the way:

```tsx
render(<App />, {
  title: 'Notes',
  focus: process.env.GPUIX_BACKGROUND !== '1',
})
```

```bash
bun app.tsx                      # you: window comes to the front
GPUIX_BACKGROUND=1 bun app.tsx   # agent: window opens behind your editor
```

`launch()` passes `env` straight through, so an agent script sets it once and
every screenshot, click, and assertion runs on a window that never interrupts
you:

```ts
import { launch } from '@gpuix/react/automation'

const app = await launch({
  command: 'bun',
  args: ['app.tsx'],
  env: { GPUIX_BACKGROUND: '1' },
})

await app.getByTestId('bump').waitFor()
await app.getByTestId('bump').click()
await app.screenshot({ path: 'tmp/after-click.png' })
await app.close()
```

Focus is the only thing that changes. **Automation does not need focus.**
`click()` hits the last painted bounds and `screenshot()` reads the GPU
surface, so both work while the window sits behind your editor, and even on a
`show: false` window that is not on screen at all.

```
  agent ──►  launch({ env: { GPUIX_BACKGROUND: '1' } })
                │
                ▼
           GPU window renders and paints without activation
                │
                ├──►  getByTestId(..).click()   ✓  hits the last painted bounds
                ├──►  screenshot({ path })      ✓  reads the GPU surface
                ├──►  fill() / press()          ✓  uses the live input pipeline
                └──►  close()

  you   ──►  keep typing, your editor stays frontmost the whole time
```

`fill()` and `press()` use the live GPUI window input pipeline. They work
without activating the desktop window. **Linux ignores `focus`**, so an agent
there still gets a focused window.

Prefer `createTestRoot()` when you can. It opens **no window at all**, so
nothing can steal focus and keyboard input works. Reach for `launch()` plus
`focus: false` when the check needs a real window, real GPU paint, or a real
process.

### flushSync

The root is a **concurrent root**, so React commits in a later microtask.
`flushSync` forces the render and the commit to finish before it returns, the
same as in `react-dom`.

```tsx
import { flushSync } from '@gpuix/react'

flushSync(() => setSidebarOpen(true))
```

It flushes **React only**, down to one `applyBatch` call. After it returns the
native retained tree is up to date, including styles and text.

It does **not** wait for GPUI. Layout and paint still happen on the next frame,
exactly like the browser paints after a DOM mutation. To see pixels, wait a
frame in the app, or call `renderer.flush()` in a test.

Use it when an ordering bug depends on the commit landing first: an unmount
before a remount, or a state change before you feed the next event.

## Debug frame overlay

GPUI paints frame-time stats into the window after layout. The overlay is not
a React element. A React FPS label would update every frame and cause more work.

```tsx
render(<App />, { title: 'My App', debugFrameOverlay: 'full' })
```

| Mode | What you see |
|---|---|
| `hidden` | nothing (default) |
| `minimal` | last draw time, e.g. `8.3 MS` |
| `full` | `CUR`, `1%`, `10%`, `MAX`, `FRAMES` |

Or call the renderer:

```ts
renderer.setDebugFrameOverlay('full')
renderer.cycleDebugFrameOverlay()
renderer.resetDebugFrameOverlayStats()
renderer.getDebugFrameOverlay() // 'hidden' | 'minimal' | 'full'
renderer.getDebugFrameOverlayStats()
// { currentMs, p90Ms, p99Ms, maxMs, frames, samples }
```

`p90Ms` is the overlay **10%** line. `p99Ms` is the **1%** line. Those are the slow tail.

The overlay shows **draw time**, not FPS. `8.3 MS` is about 120 Hz.

The chat example has a regression test for this: `examples/chat.perf.test.tsx`. It times mount, wheel draw, and sidebar clicks. It asserts p95, not every frame.

The default example suite excludes this hardware-timing test so shared CI runner variance does not fail functional checks. Run it explicitly on the target Mac:

On macOS, `THROTTLE=utility` restarts the process under `taskpolicy -c utility`. That pins work to E-cores. It is an **M1/M2 Air CPU** proxy, not Chrome 6x. GPU and RAM stay fast. `THROTTLE=background` is slower.

```bash
cd examples
THROTTLE=utility bun run test:perf
THROTTLE=utility bun --hot chat.tsx
```

## Hot reload

### 1. End the file with `render()`

```tsx
import { render } from '@gpuix/react'

function App() {
  return <div style={{ padding: 16 }}>hello</div>
}

render(<App />, { title: 'My App', width: 800, height: 600 })
```

Do **not** call `createRenderer()` or `init()` in this file. `bun --hot` re-runs
the whole entry on save. A second `init()` would open a second window.

### 2. Start the app with `bun --hot`

Prefer **`bun --hot`** over a plain `bun` or `tsx` run. Without `--hot`, a
save starts a second process. With it, `render()` remounts React on the same
window.

```bash
bun --hot app.tsx
cd examples && bun --hot chat.tsx
```

### 3. Save the file

```
save .tsx  ►  bun re-evaluates the entry  ►  render() remounts React
                     │
                     ▼
              GpuixRenderer, window, GPU stay
```

The first `render()` creates the native host and stores it on `globalThis`.
Each save unmounts the React tree and mounts a new one on that same host.

**Stays:** window, GPU device, native `.node` addon, GPUI scroll physics.

**Resets:** `useState`, focus, React event handlers.

This is a remount, not React Refresh. Keeping hook state needs Bun to inject
`$RefreshReg$` during `--hot`. That transform exists on
`bun build --react-fast-refresh` only. Tracked in
[oven-sh/bun#40179](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/40179).

Native `.node` edits still need a rebuild. See [Developing the Rust side](#developing-the-rust-side).

On **macOS**, `startFrameLoop` calls `renderer.tick()` at a fixed rate (~125fps by
default). Each tick drains only ready AppKit events and Core Foundation sources,
then returns without waiting for the next native wake. Bun timers, sockets, promises,
and PTY callbacks can run between ticks. Pass `{ frameMs }` to change the rate, and
call `.stop()` on the returned handle to end it.

On **Windows and Linux**, GPUI runs its normal blocking native event loop on one
dedicated Rust UI thread. Node sends in-process commands to that thread, so
`startFrameLoop` returns a no-op handle and does not create a JavaScript timer.
All platforms use GPUI's native platform, window, renderer, input, scroll,
clipboard, keyboard, and IME implementations. The embedded macOS run-loop
extension comes from the pinned GPUIX fork. CI runs the full React and example
test suites through DirectX on Windows.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On macOS, never drive `tick()` from a `setImmediate` loop. That spins at tens of thousands of
> ticks per second and burns **73% CPU on a completely idle app**, versus **1%** when
> paced.

## Native animations

Use **`motion.div`** to animate from an initial style to a target style. React
sends the target once. Rust calculates intermediate values and requests GPUI
frames until the transition finishes, without a React render or N-API call for
each frame.

### Animate a target

```tsx
import { motion } from '@gpuix/react'

function WelcomeCard() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ width: 0, opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ width: 320, opacity: 1 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.25, ease: 'easeOut' }}
      style={{ overflow: 'hidden' }}
    >
      <text style={{ color: '#ffffff' }}>Welcome</text>
    </motion.div>
  )
}
```

Set **`initial={false}`** when the element must mount at its first `animate`
target. Later `animate` changes still transition normally. If a target changes
while motion is active, the next transition starts from the current visible
value, so reversing an animation does not jump.

### Targets and timing

Motion currently accepts these **numeric targets**:

| Target | Range or unit |
|---|---|
| `width`, `height` | pixels, zero or greater |
| `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` | pixels |
| `opacity` | `0` through `1` |
| `borderRadius` | pixels, zero or greater |

The **transition** uses seconds, like Motion for React:

| Option | Default | Values |
|---|---:|---|
| `duration` | `0.3` | Non-negative seconds |
| `delay` | `0` | Non-negative seconds |
| `ease` | `"easeOut"` | `"linear"`, `"ease"`, `"easeIn"`, `"easeOut"`, `"easeInOut"`, or `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` |

Springs, keyframes, variants, exit transitions, and shared layout animations
are not available yet.

### Animate a sidebar

Animate an **outer clipping container** and keep the inner sidebar at a fixed
width. This reveals or hides the content without reflowing its text on every
frame.

```tsx
import { motion } from '@gpuix/react'
import type { ReactNode } from 'react'

function SidebarFrame({
  collapsed,
  children,
}: {
  collapsed: boolean
  children: ReactNode
}) {
  const sidebarWidth = 252
  const dividerWidth = 1

  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={false}
      animate={{ width: collapsed ? 0 : sidebarWidth + dividerWidth }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.2, ease: 'easeOut' }}
      style={{
        display: 'flex',
        flexDirection: 'row',
        height: '100%',
        flexShrink: 0,
        overflow: 'hidden',
      }}
    >
      <div style={{ width: sidebarWidth, height: '100%', flexShrink: 0 }}>
        {children}
      </div>
      <div style={{ width: dividerWidth, height: '100%', flexShrink: 0 }} />
    </motion.div>
  )
}
```

The **chat example** uses this pattern. The sidebar remains mounted while its
outer width moves between `253` and `0` pixels.

### Capture exact frames

The [automation API](#automation) can freeze the native motion clock and render
specific timestamps. This avoids timer sleeps and gives CI the same frames on
every run.

```tsx
import { connectTest } from '@gpuix/react/automation'
import { createTestRoot } from '@gpuix/react/testing'
import { ChatApp } from './chat'

const { render, renderer } = createTestRoot()
render(<ChatApp />)
const app = await connectTest(renderer)

const startedAt = await app.clock.pause()
await app.getByTestId('sidebar-collapse').click()

await app.captureFrames('review/sidebar', [
  startedAt,
  startedAt + 50,
  startedAt + 100,
  startedAt + 150,
  startedAt + 200,
])

await app.clock.resume()
```

## Scrolling

Containers with `overflow: "scroll"` become natively scrollable. GPUI handles scroll physics, clipping, and offset persistence automatically.

Plain scroll containers still build every child. Use `<virtual-list>` below when the collection can grow large.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Nested scrolling is not supported.** One parent may scroll. An inner
> `overflow: "scroll"`, `<virtual-list>`, or `<diff>` must not. GPUI gives both
> hitboxes the same wheel event, so the inner list steals the gesture.
>
> Keep long inner content in that parent. Collapse it behind an **expandable**
> (preview plus Show more) instead of giving the child its own viewport.
>
> Horizontal overflow is the exception. `overflowX: "scroll"` on a wide child
> (a code row, a table) does not steal the vertical wheel. GPUIX lays that
> scroller out as a flex viewport with `minWidth: 0`. The wide child must not
> shrink: set `flexShrink: 0` or a definite width. Swipe on **X** to pan.
> A vertical wheel stays on the parent.

```tsx
function Expandable({
  preview,
  children,
}: {
  preview: React.ReactNode
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', gap: 8 }}>
      {open ? children : preview}
      {!open && <div onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Show more</div>}
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx
function ScrollableList() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: 300, overflow: 'scroll' }}>
      {items.map((item, i) => (
        <div key={i} style={{ height: 60, padding: 12 }}>
          {item.name}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Per-axis scrolling: use `overflowX: "scroll"` or `overflowY: "scroll"`.
`overflow: "scroll"` scrolls both axes at once from a single diagonal gesture,
like a browser.

A flex column stretches its children to the cross axis, so a two-axis container
needs its rows to state a width. Without one there is nothing to pan on **X**:

```tsx
<div style={{ width: 260, height: 220, overflow: 'scroll', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>
  {rows.map((row) => (
    <div key={row.id} style={{ display: 'flex', width: 810, flexShrink: 0 }}>
      {row.cells}
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```

### Panes that must move together

A native scroll container cannot drive a **frozen header**. GPUI moves the
container on the wheel frame, and the JavaScript callback that would move the
header arrives a frame later, so the header tears away during a fast pan.

When two panes must stay locked to the pixel, own the offset in React: put one
`onScroll` listener on a non-scrolling parent, keep `scrollX` and `scrollY` in
state, and translate each pane's content with an absolutely positioned wrapper.
Zed does the same; the editor owns its scroll position and paints the gutter and
the text from it.

```tsx
function Pane({ offsetX, children }: { offsetX: number; children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div style={{ flexGrow: 1, minWidth: 0, overflow: 'hidden', position: 'relative' }}>
      {/* An empty positioned box still takes hits, so opt it out. */}
      <div style={{ position: 'absolute', left: -offsetX, top: 0, pointerEvents: 'none' }}>
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Keep the moving subtree in a `memo` component whose props do not change during a
pan. The wheel then costs a handful of style mutations, not one per row. The
[timeline example](./examples/timeline.tsx) does this for a ruler, a track
column, and a clip grid.

For programmatic scroll control, use a React ref to get the element's numeric ID, then call the renderer's scroll methods:

```tsx
function ProgrammaticScroll() {
  const listRef = useRef<any>(null)

  const jumpToBottom = () => {
    if (listRef.current) {
      renderer.scrollTo(listRef.current.id, 0, -999)
    }
  }

  return (
    <>
      <div ref={listRef} style={{ height: 200, overflow: 'scroll' }}>
        {items.map((item, i) => <div key={i}>{item}</div>)}
      </div>
      <div onClick={jumpToBottom}>Jump to bottom</div>
    </>
  )
}

// Available scroll methods on the renderer:
renderer.scrollTo(elementId, x, y)        // set offset directly
renderer.scrollToItem(elementId, index)   // scroll child into view
renderer.getScrollOffset(elementId)       // returns [x, y] or null
```

## Virtual lists

Use `<virtual-list>` for **long, variable-height collections** such as message lists. React and Rust retain every row, but GPUI only builds, lays out, and paints rows near the viewport.

```tsx
function MessageList({ messages }: { messages: Message[] }) {
  return (
    <virtual-list
      alignment="bottom"
      followTail
      estimatedItemHeight={180}
      style={{ flexGrow: 1, minHeight: 0 }}
    >
      {messages.map((message) => (
        <Message key={message.id} message={message} />
      ))}
    </virtual-list>
  )
}
```

The list needs a **bounded height** or bounded flex space. Its direct children are rows and can contain any GPUIX host or custom element.

| Prop | Default | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `alignment` | `"top"` | Use `"bottom"` for chat-style initial positioning |
| `followTail` | `false` | Follow appended rows until the user scrolls away |
| `overdraw` | `512` | Extra pixels built outside the viewport |
| `estimatedItemHeight` | none | Height hint for unmeasured rows. **Required** with `itemCount` |

### How virtualization works

**React reconciliation stays normal.** The complete keyed child list crosses the mutation protocol and remains in Rust's retained tree. GPUIX defers only the expensive GPUI element construction, layout, and paint work.

```text
React Fiber + Rust RetainedTree    all row IDs, props, text, and events
                 │
                 ▼
          GPUI ListState          row count and measured height cache
                 │
                 ▼ visible indexes plus overdraw
          cx.processor            re-enters GpuixView after root render
                 │
                 ▼
          fresh BuildCtx          builds only the requested React subtree
                 │
                 ▼
       GPUI layout and paint      visible rows only
```

### Row heights

**Rows do not need equal heights, and you do not need to know them.** GPUI measures a row when it enters the viewport. `estimatedItemHeight` is a **hint for rows nothing has measured yet**, not a size contract.

```text
index:     0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7
       ┌────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┐
       │  hint  │  hint  │measured│measured│measured│  hint  │  hint  │  hint  │
       │  220px │  220px │  184px │  512px │   96px │  220px │  220px │  220px │
       └────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┘
           ▲                          ▲                          ▲
           │                          │                          │
     estimate only         real, variable heights          estimate only
                          (viewport plus overdraw)
```

The sum of that height cache is the scroll length, so a rough estimate only affects **scrollbar accuracy** before a row is visited. The measured height replaces the estimate automatically, and the scrollbar converges as you scroll.

When a retained descendant changes, GPUIX marks its direct row for remeasurement, so a streaming row grows correctly. Appending, removing, or reordering keyed rows keeps measurements for rows whose IDs did not change.

`estimatedItemHeight` is optional in children mode, where every row exists and can be measured. It is **required** with `itemCount`, because React never mounts the rows outside the window and native has no element to measure. Those indexes render as an empty box of the estimated height until React mounts the real row.

### Row boundaries

Each **direct host child** is one virtual row. Give every row a stable React key and one host root:

```tsx
<virtual-list style={{ height: 500 }}>
  {messages.map((message) => (
    <div key={message.id} style={{ paddingBottom: 24 }}>
      <Message message={message} />
    </div>
  ))}
</virtual-list>
```

A row can contain nested `<div>`, `<text>`, `<markdown>`, `<code>`, `<diff>`, `<input>`, and `<textarea>` elements. Focusable rows stay active when they move offscreen, so keyboard input and native editor state are preserved. Those children must not scroll. Nested scrolling is not supported; see [Scrolling](#scrolling).

### Chat tail behavior

Combine `alignment="bottom"` and `followTail` for a chat thread:

```tsx
<virtual-list
  alignment="bottom"
  followTail
  estimatedItemHeight={220}
  style={{ flexGrow: 1, minHeight: 0 }}
>
  {turns.map((turn) => (
    <ChatTurn key={turn.id} turn={turn} />
  ))}
</virtual-list>
```

The list follows new rows while the user is at the bottom. Scrolling upward pauses tail following. Returning to the bottom enables it again. A streaming final row is remeasured as its content grows.

### Scroll anchoring

The list is anchored on a **row index**, not on a pixel offset. In children mode React reconciles by key, so that index still lands on the same row after a prepend: the rows already on screen stay exactly where they are. A browser does the same, and calls it scroll anchoring.

One exception, also copied from the browser: a top-aligned list that is scrolled to the **very top** stays at the top, so a prepended row is visible.

```text
scrolled down                          pinned to the top
┌──────────────────┐                   ┌──────────────────┐
│ new row  (above) │  ◄── inserted     │ new row          │  ◄── inserted, visible
├──────────────────┤                   ├──────────────────┤
│ ░░ viewport ░░░░ │  stays put        │ ░░ viewport ░░░░ │  follows the insert
│ ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ │                   │ ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ │
└──────────────────┘                   └──────────────────┘
```

That is what a todo list or a feed wants: `setItems((current) => [fresh, ...current])` puts the new row on screen. A history pane that loads older pages while the user reads should use `alignment="bottom"` instead, so a page load never moves the text.

**With `itemCount`, the app owns the correction.** There is no key to reconcile against, so the index is all there is. Prepending shifts every row down one slot, and the anchor keeps pointing at the old number, so the content slides by exactly the number of rows you inserted. Move `windowStart` by the same amount:

```tsx
const prepend = (fresh: Row) => {
  setRows((current) => [fresh, ...current])
  // The anchor is an index. One new row above the window means every existing
  // row moved down one, so the window has to move with it.
  setWindowStart((start) => (start === 0 ? 0 : start + 1))
}
```

Leave `windowStart` at `0` alone; the list is pinned to the top there and the new row should be visible.

### Programmatic scrolling

Use a ref to call the same renderer scroll methods as a plain scroll container:

```tsx
function Results({ rows }: { rows: Result[] }) {
  const renderer = useGpuixRequired()
  const listRef = useRef<{ id: number } | null>(null)

  const reveal = (index: number) => {
    if (listRef.current) {
      renderer.scrollToItem?.(listRef.current.id, index)
    }
  }

  return (
    <>
      <virtual-list ref={listRef} style={{ height: 400 }}>
        {rows.map((row) => (
          <ResultRow key={row.id} row={row} />
        ))}
      </virtual-list>
      <div onClick={() => reveal(rows.length - 1)}>Reveal latest</div>
    </>
  )
}
```

`scrollTo`, `scrollToItem`, and `getScrollOffset` all support virtual lists.

On a virtual list, `scrollToItem` takes an optional **pixel offset** and the
list reports its logical anchor:

```tsx
renderer.scrollToItem(listId, index, offsetInItem)  // offset in px, may be negative
renderer.getListScrollTop(listId)  // [itemIndex, offsetInItemPx, viewportHeightPx] or null
```

A **negative offset anchors the viewport top above the row**, and the next
layout resolves it against real measured heights. That is the tool for
infinite-scroll history: while the reader waits in a loading row, read
`getListScrollTop`, commit the fetched page, then re-anchor on the message
that was under the loading row with a negative offset. The message stays at
the same pixel while the new rows are measured above it —
`examples/infinite-chat.tsx` is the worked example.

An `itemIndex` equal to the item count is gpui's **at-end sentinel**: a
bottom-aligned list resting at its very end. A reader waiting at a trailing
loading row usually sits there, and the viewport height in the same tuple is
what converts that into a position relative to the trailing rows
(`EDGE_HEIGHT - viewportHeight` in the example).

Virtual-list `scrollToItem` calls are applied on the **next render, after
that frame's child splice**, so an index computed against a just-committed
child list is never shifted twice.

### Performance model

| Work | Plain scroll container | `<virtual-list>` children | `<virtual-list>` + `itemCount` |
|---|---|---|---|
| React Fiber nodes | All rows | All rows | Visible window |
| Rust retained nodes | All rows | All rows | Visible window |
| GPUI row construction | All rows | Visible rows plus overdraw | Visible rows plus overdraw |
| Layout and paint | All rows | Visible rows plus overdraw | Visible rows plus overdraw |
| Height metadata | None | One lightweight entry per row | One lightweight entry per logical row |

The children form still creates every React child, so a 10,000-row `turns.map` is slow to mount. Pass `itemCount` and `windowStart` and render only that slice to mount a window too. Collections with millions of rows still need application-level paging or a data-owning native element.

### Keep scroll fast

A wheel event notifies the window view. GPUI then rebuilds the **visible**
rows and Taffy lays them out again. Draw time is the cost of those rows, not
the length of the list.

Put a long list on `<virtual-list>`. Keep `overdraw` near one extra
viewport. Put fat content in one native node (`<markdown>`, `<code>`, `<diff>`),
not a tree of React spans.

The host `<virtual-list>` still retains every React child. Pass `itemCount`,
`estimatedItemHeight` and `windowStart`, then render only that window, so mount
does not create every row. Native ignores `itemCount` when the estimate is
missing, so a jump cannot collapse unmounted rows to height 0.

There is **no `VirtualList` wrapper component**. The window is app state:
only the app knows when it must widen, for example when a filter grows
`itemCount` without any scroll. Keep `start` in `useState`, move it from
`onVisibleRange`, and slice around it.

```tsx
const WINDOW = 40

const Transcript = memo(function Transcript({ turns }: { turns: Turn[] }) {
  const [start, setStart] = useState(0)
  const end = Math.min(turns.length, start + WINDOW)
  return (
    <virtual-list
      itemCount={turns.length}
      windowStart={start}
      estimatedItemHeight={220}
      style={{ flexGrow: 1, minHeight: 0 }}
      onVisibleRange={(event) =>
        setStart(Math.max(0, Math.floor(event.startIndex ?? 0) - WINDOW / 4))
      }
    >
      {turns.slice(start, end).map((turn) => (
        <ChatTurn key={turn.id} turn={turn} />
      ))}
    </virtual-list>
  )
})

function ChatApp() {
  const [collapsed, setCollapsed] = useState(false)
  const [turns, setTurns] = useState(initialTurns)
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row', height: '100%' }}>
      <Sidebar collapsed={collapsed} onCollapse={() => setCollapsed(true)} />
      <Transcript turns={turns} />
      <Composer onSend={(text) => setTurns((current) => [...current, { text }])} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

`turns` is a new array only when a message arrives. Sidebar and draft updates
leave that reference alone, so `memo` skips the map. The chat example uses
this pattern.

`overflowX: "scroll"` on a wide child must not steal the vertical wheel.
GPUIX sets `restrict_scroll_to_axis` on that path. Native
`overflow_x_scroll()` must call the same method.

Turn on `debugFrameOverlay: 'full'` while you scroll. The overlay is **draw
time**. `8.3 MS` is about 120 Hz.

### Pannable surfaces must cull

`<virtual-list>` is the only thing that virtualizes. A surface where **you** own
the offset — a timeline, a node graph, a map — places its children absolutely,
so GPUI builds and lays out **every** retained child on every frame. Nothing
skips them for you.

`memo` and culling fix different halves, and only one of them is the draw:

```
memo(Layer)  ►  cuts React work and the applyBatch mutations
cull in JS   ►  cuts GPUI build, Taffy layout, and paint
```

You already know the offset, so the visible window is a `useMemo` away:

```tsx
const visible = useMemo(() => {
  const from = scrollX / pxPerSecond
  const to = (scrollX + viewportWidth) / pxPerSecond
  return clips.filter((clip) => clip.start <= to && clip.start + clip.duration >= from)
}, [clips, scrollX, pxPerSecond, viewportWidth])
```

The timeline example measures both, on 3,259 clips across 26 tracks:

| Wheel pan, one full frame | p50 |
|---|---|
| Culled | **7.7 ms** |
| `memo` only, no culling | **92 ms** |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A perf sample must include `renderer.flush()`. Without it you time the React
> update and none of the GPUI build, layout, and paint that follows. The
> `memo`-only number above looks like **0.6 ms** if you forget.

## Text input

`<input>` and `<textarea>` use GPUI's platform input handler. They support a
native caret, text selection, IME composition, clipboard actions, undo/redo,
grapheme-safe deletion and mouse positioning.

```tsx
<textarea
  value={draft}
  placeholder="Ask anything"
  minRows={1}
  maxRows={8}
  onChange={(event) => setDraft(event.value ?? '')}
  onSubmit={send}
/>
```

`Enter` emits `onSubmit`. In a `<textarea>`, `Shift+Enter` inserts a newline.
The editor updates natively first, then reports the complete value to React.
`value` changes can replace the native content, but keeping the same prop value
does not reject an edit like a browser-controlled input.

The focused caret stays solid during edits and then blinks every 500ms while
idle. It stops scheduling repaint frames on blur or while the window is
inactive. Override its colour through the shared native theme:

```tsx
<input theme={{ caret: '#22c55e' }} />
```

## Focus and keyboard navigation

Focus is a **native GPUI concept**. GPUIX connects stable React element IDs to
persistent `gpui::FocusHandle` values, so focus survives React rerenders:

```text
React <div tabIndex={0}>
            │
            ▼
Retained element ID ► persistent gpui::FocusHandle ► keyboard/action dispatch
            ▲
            │
      React rerenders
```

Inputs and textareas are tab stops automatically. Add `tabIndex` to a `div` when
it should participate in explicit focus traversal:

```tsx
<div
  tabIndex={0}
  onFocus={() => setActive(true)}
  onBlur={() => setActive(false)}
  onKeyDown={(event) => {
    if (event.key === 'enter') submit()
  }}
>
  Submit
</div>
```

| Prop | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `tabIndex={0}` | Joins the normal focus traversal order |
| `tabIndex={n}` | Uses `n` as its GPUI tab-order index |
| `tabIndex={-1}` | Skipped by focus traversal, but focusable by click or renderer API |
| `autoFocus` | Takes focus once, when its native focus handle is created |

### Element keyboard callbacks

`onKeyDown` fires for the focused element and then for ancestors that declare
`onKeyDown`, following GPUI's focus dispatch path. `onKeyUp` follows the same
path when the key is released. Adding either callback creates the element's
native focus handle.

```tsx
<div
  autoFocus
  tabIndex={0}
  onKeyDown={(event) => {
    console.log(event.key, event.keyChar, event.modifiers, event.isHeld)
  }}
  onKeyUp={(event) => {
    console.log(`${event.key} released`)
  }}
>
  Focused target
</div>
```

GPUI dispatches matching key actions before raw keyboard callbacks. If an
action consumes the key, `onKeyDown` does not fire. GPUIX does not bind `Tab` or
`Shift+Tab`, so both reach element callbacks. Editors and terminals can send
them directly to their input backend.

### Renderer keyboard callbacks

Pass `onKeyDown` or `onKeyUp` to `render()` for an opt-in window-level listener.
The renderer callback fires after element callbacks for raw keys that no GPUI
action consumed. It receives the renderer as its second argument:

```tsx
render(<App />, {
  onKeyDown(event, renderer) {
    if (event.key !== 'tab') return
    if (event.modifiers?.shift) renderer.focusPrevious?.()
    else renderer.focusNext?.()
  },
})
```

These callbacks observe native events. They do not expose GPUI's propagation
control, so they cannot cancel or stop the native event.

### Imperative focus

`focusNext()` and `focusPrevious()` map directly to GPUI's
`window.focus_next()` and `window.focus_prev()`.

Use a ref for imperative focus:

```tsx
const buttonRef = useRef<{ id: number }>(null)

function focusButton() {
  if (buttonRef.current) renderer.focusElement(buttonRef.current.id)
}

<div ref={buttonRef} tabIndex={-1}>Focused on demand</div>
```

Adding `onKeyDown`, `onKeyUp`, `onFocus`, or `onBlur` creates a persistent focus
handle. Add `tabIndex` as well when the element must be reachable through focus
traversal. Removing `tabIndex` removes the element from that order.

## Headless controls

The built-in controls are **unstyled primitives**, not a fixed component
library. Use them like Radix primitives in shadcn: import a primitive namespace,
wrap and style it in a local file, then import those local components throughout
the app.

```text
@gpuix/react/select ► components/ui/select.tsx ► application screens
  native behavior       local styles/variants       product-specific use
```

Each primitive has a dedicated namespace entry point:

| Import | Main parts |
|---|---|
| `@gpuix/react/select` | `Root`, `Trigger`, `Value`, `Content`, `Item` |
| `@gpuix/react/combobox` | `Root`, `Input`, `Content`, `List`, `Item`, `Empty` |
| `@gpuix/react/tooltip` | `Provider`, `Root`, `Trigger`, `Content` |

### Build a local Select

Create `components/ui/select.tsx`. This file is application code, so it can be
copied and changed without waiting for GPUIX to add a theme option:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import * as SelectPrimitive from '@gpuix/react/select'

export const Select = SelectPrimitive.Root
export const SelectValue = SelectPrimitive.Value
export const SelectGroup = SelectPrimitive.Group

export const SelectTrigger = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof SelectPrimitive.Trigger>,
  SelectPrimitive.SelectTriggerProps
>(({ style, ...props }, ref) => (
  <SelectPrimitive.Trigger
    ref={ref}
    {...props}
    style={(state) => ({
      width: 220,
      height: 36,
      padding: 8,
      backgroundColor: state.open ? '#334155' : '#1e293b',
      borderRadius: 8,
      ...(typeof style === 'function' ? style(state) : style),
    })}
  />
))

export const SelectContent = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof SelectPrimitive.Content>,
  SelectPrimitive.SelectContentProps
>(({ style, ...props }, ref) => (
  <SelectPrimitive.Content
    ref={ref}
    sideOffset={6}
    {...props}
    style={{
      width: 220,
      maxHeight: 240,
      overflowY: 'scroll',
      padding: 4,
      backgroundColor: '#0f172a',
      borderRadius: 8,
      ...style,
    }}
  />
))

export const SelectItem = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof SelectPrimitive.Item>,
  SelectPrimitive.SelectItemProps
>(({ style, ...props }, ref) => (
  <SelectPrimitive.Item
    ref={ref}
    {...props}
    style={(state) => ({
      padding: 8,
      opacity: state.disabled ? 0.4 : 1,
      backgroundColor: state.highlighted
        ? '#334155'
        : state.selected
          ? '#1e3a5f'
          : '#0f172a',
      ...(typeof style === 'function' ? style(state) : style),
    })}
  />
))
```

Use the styled local file with the familiar shadcn shape:

```tsx
import {
  Select,
  SelectContent,
  SelectGroup,
  SelectItem,
  SelectTrigger,
  SelectValue,
} from './components/ui/select'

<Select value={model} onValueChange={setModel}>
  <SelectTrigger>
    <SelectValue placeholder="Select a model" />
  </SelectTrigger>
  <SelectContent>
    <SelectGroup>
      <SelectItem value="sonnet">Sonnet</SelectItem>
      <SelectItem value="opus">Opus</SelectItem>
    </SelectGroup>
  </SelectContent>
</Select>
```

The trigger participates in normal tab navigation. Opening the Select focuses
its content. `Up`, `Down`, `Ctrl+P`, `Ctrl+N`, `Enter`, and `Escape` control the
menu. Closing it restores focus to the trigger. Disabled items are skipped.

### Style Combobox and Tooltip the same way

Start their local files from namespace imports too:

```tsx
// components/ui/combobox.tsx
import * as ComboboxPrimitive from '@gpuix/react/combobox'

// components/ui/tooltip.tsx
import * as TooltipPrimitive from '@gpuix/react/tooltip'
```

The application still uses compound components, not one large configuration
object:

```tsx
<ComboboxPrimitive.Root items={['Next.js', 'SvelteKit', 'Astro']}>
  <ComboboxPrimitive.Input style={{ width: 220, height: 36, padding: 8 }} />
  <ComboboxPrimitive.Content style={{ width: 220 }}>
    <ComboboxPrimitive.Empty>No frameworks found.</ComboboxPrimitive.Empty>
    <ComboboxPrimitive.List>
      {(item) => (
        <ComboboxPrimitive.Item key={item} value={item}>
          {item}
        </ComboboxPrimitive.Item>
      )}
    </ComboboxPrimitive.List>
  </ComboboxPrimitive.Content>
</ComboboxPrimitive.Root>
```

```tsx
<TooltipPrimitive.Provider delayDuration={350}>
  <TooltipPrimitive.Root>
    <TooltipPrimitive.Trigger asChild>
      <div tabIndex={0} style={{ padding: 8 }}>Copy</div>
    </TooltipPrimitive.Trigger>
    <TooltipPrimitive.Content side="top" sideOffset={6}>
      Copy message
    </TooltipPrimitive.Content>
  </TooltipPrimitive.Root>
</TooltipPrimitive.Provider>
```

Combobox uses the native input for text editing, IME, clipboard, and focus.
Tooltip `asChild` preserves the child ref and merges trigger behavior into that
host element. All floating content uses GPUI's deferred `anchored()` layer,
snaps inside the window, and occludes controls behind it.

### Overlay menus

Menus, tooltips, and dialogs must use **`SelectContent`**, **`ComboboxContent`**,
or `<anchored deferred>`. Those paint in a later pass, on top of
`<virtual-list>` and the rest of the page.

A `position: "absolute"` card that overflows out of the composer sits **under**
the virtual list. The list paints after the composer, so you still see the
markdown through the menu, and clicks hit the text behind it.

```tsx
<Select value={model} onValueChange={setModel}>
  <div style={{ position: 'relative' }}>
    <SelectTrigger>
      <SelectValue />
    </SelectTrigger>
    <SelectContent side="top" sideOffset={4} style={{ backgroundColor: '#232323' }}>
      <SelectItem value="flash">DeepSeek V4 Flash</SelectItem>
    </SelectContent>
  </div>
</Select>
```

Give every overlay an **opaque** fill (`#232323`, not `#23232399`).
`FloatingLayer` defaults to `#1A1A1A`. Item rows should use the same solid
color, or a solid hover color. A `#00000000` child on a blurred window punches
through Metal to the desktop.

A `div` that paints a fill, or that is positioned, blocks clicks and hovers
behind it. The **wheel still passes**, so a pannable canvas can place its items
absolutely and keep panning.

Set **`pointerEvents: "auto"`** on an element that must swallow the wheel too,
like a modal backdrop. `<anchored>` occludes by default and has its own
`occlude` prop, so menus and tooltips need neither.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The wheel does not bubble the way DOM events do. GPUI hit-tests one flat list
> of painted boxes, so the wheel reaches **any** scroller behind the element,
> not only an ancestor. An absolute card floating over an unrelated scroll pane
> will scroll that pane. Give a real overlay `pointerEvents: "auto"`.

`pointerEvents: "none"` means the element inserts **no hitbox**, so it blocks
nothing behind it. It does not disable the listeners on that same element, and
it does not inherit, so children keep their own hitboxes.

## Text selection

Every text GPUIX paints is **selectable and copyable**, including text inside
`<code>`, `<diff>` and `<markdown>`. A drag that starts in a heading and ends
inside a fenced code block selects everything between; Cmd+C copies it joined in
document order.

There is nothing to opt into. To opt *out* — toolbars, buttons, line-number
gutters — set `userSelect: "none"`, which inherits like the CSS property:

```tsx
<div style={{ userSelect: 'none' }}>
  <text>toolbar label, never selected</text>
</div>
```

![Text selected across markdown blocks](./docs/images/selection.png)

Read the selection from the renderer:

```tsx
renderer.getSelectedText()   // joined text, or null
renderer.clearSelection()
```

Selection works because each painted text element registers itself into a
per-frame registry in **paint order**, which is document order. A drag anchored
in one element resolves against that registry into per-element spans: partial in
the anchor and head, whole for everything between.

<details>
<summary>Why not one big text element, like Zed?</summary>

Zed's markdown selects continuously because its whole document is a single
element over one text model. GPUIX renders a *tree* of text elements, so it
rebuilds that continuity at paint time instead. The mechanism is ported from
[Comet](https://github.com/zeronsh/comet) (MIT), which faced the same problem.
</details>

## Text highlighting and search

The **`highlight` prop** paints a background wash behind matched text. Put it on
any element and it applies to that element's subtree, so the root searches the
window and a container searches only that container.

```tsx
<div highlight={{ query: 'fox' }}>
  <text>the quick brown fox</text>
</div>
```

It reaches `<text>`, `<code>`, `<markdown>` and `<diff>` with no extra props,
because every string GPUIX paints goes through the same funnel.

### A find bar

`useTextSearch` owns the cursor and the count. `next` and `previous` are plain
event handlers, so nothing here needs an effect.

```tsx
import { useTextSearch } from '@gpuix/react'

function Find() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('')
  const search = useTextSearch({ query })

  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', flex: 1 }}>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: 8, alignItems: 'center' }}>
        <input value={query} onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.value ?? '')} />
        <text>{search.total === 0 ? 'No results' : `${search.active + 1}/${search.total}`}</text>
        <div onClick={search.previous}><text>↑</text></div>
        <div onClick={search.next}><text>↓</text></div>
      </div>

      <div {...search.props} style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <Transcript />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Explicit ranges

When you already have offsets, from an LSP range or your own model, pass them
instead of a query. They are `[start, end)` in **UTF-16 code units**, the units
`indexOf` and `RegExp.exec` return.

```tsx
<div highlight={{ ranges: [[6, 11]], color: '#f43f5e55' }}>
  <text>Hello {name}!</text>
</div>
```

A pair that splits a surrogate pair is **rejected**, never snapped. Ranges index
retained text only; native elements build their strings in Rust, so use `query`
for those.

### Options

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `query` | substring to match, case-insensitive by default |
| `caseSensitive` | exact case only |
| `wholeWord` | neither neighbour may be alphanumeric or `_` |
| `ranges` | explicit `[start, end)` UTF-16 pairs |
| `color` / `activeColor` | any CSS colour; defaults come from the theme |
| `activeIndex` | which match gets `activeColor`, for a find cursor |
| `matchIndexOffset` | matches before this subtree; only for virtualized content |
| `radius` | corner radius of the wash, default 2 |

Pass an **array** to paint several at once, for example search matches plus a
persistent mention tint. Later entries draw on top.

### Matching rules

Matches are **non-overlapping** and leftmost-first. Case-insensitive matching
uses Unicode **lowercasing**, not full case folding, so `ﬀ` does not match `ff`.
A word boundary is any code point that is not Unicode Alphabetic, a digit,
or `_`.

A match never crosses a line, exactly like browser find. It **does** cross the
several host nodes React creates for one interpolated line, which matters more
than it sounds:

```tsx
// React makes 3 host text nodes here. `Hello Tommy` still matches.
<div highlight={{ query: 'Hello Tommy' }}>
  <text>Hello {name}!</text>
</div>
```

The nearest declaration wins, so a nested `highlight` replaces its ancestor's
for that subtree.

**`userSelect: "none"` does not opt out of search.** A browser still finds that
text, so GPUIX still highlights it. Only element chrome, a code gutter or a diff
file header, is excluded.

<details>
<summary>Searching a virtual list</summary>

`<virtual-list>` never builds off-screen rows, so native can only see the
mounted window. Two things follow, and both are the app's job because the app
owns the row data.

**Count the matches yourself** with `findRanges`, which runs the same algorithm
as the native matcher on a string you give it.

**Say where your window starts**, as a count of **matches** above it, not a row
index. Without it native numbers the mounted rows from zero, `activeIndex` means
"the nth visible match", and the find cursor lands on the wrong row.

Both numbers travel together in `matches`, because supplying one without the
other is always wrong.

```tsx
import { findRanges, useTextSearch } from '@gpuix/react'

// One entry per row, so a prefix sum gives both numbers.
const perRow = useMemo(
  () => rows.map((row) => findRanges({ text: row.text, query }).length),
  [rows, query],
)

const search = useTextSearch({
  query,
  matches: {
    total: perRow.reduce((n, count) => n + count, 0),
    indexOffset: perRow.slice(0, windowStart).reduce((n, count) => n + count, 0),
  },
})

// search.next() moves the cursor; you do the scrolling
listRef.current.scrollToItem(rowOfMatch(search.active))
```

`findRanges` matches the native algorithm for the **same** string. Call it on
the same logical lines native paints: adjacent text nodes of one parent are one
line, and `<markdown>` paints inline runs rather than its source.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why a wash and not gpui's HighlightStyle</summary>

`HighlightStyle.background_color` is painted natively by gpui, but only with
square corners, and it cannot report the boxes it drew. GPUIX paints quads from
`range_rects`, the same helper selection and inline-code pills use, so a
soft-wrapped match is one box per visual row and `getPaintedHighlights()` can
assert the geometry without a screenshot. Zed's own editor paints search
highlights manually for the same reason.
</details>

## Native text components

Three elements render text with Syntect syntax highlighting computed in
Rust. Colours come from a theme prop, so a late-arriving highlight recolours runs
without ever changing layout.

### `<code>`

A syntax-highlighted code block. One row per line at an exact line height, so the
block's height is known before highlighting runs.

It paints **no surface of its own**: no fill, border, radius, padding or language
header. `style` is the surface, so the card look is yours.

```tsx
<code
  code={source}
  language="typescript"        // or path="src/app.ts" to detect from extension
  showLineNumbers
  style={{
    padding: 12,
    borderRadius: 10,
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: '#ffffff1f',
    backgroundColor: '#ffffff09',
  }}
/>
```

![A syntax-highlighted code block](./docs/images/code.png)

`fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeight` and `color` in `style` beat
the theme. Rows are a fixed height, so `fontSize` alone scales that height by the
theme's ratio; pass `lineHeight` to set it exactly.

Two things stay owned by the element: lines **never wrap**, and the block is its
own horizontal scroller. A long line pans on a horizontal wheel inside it, so
`whiteSpace` and `overflowX` in `style` do nothing.

For a language header, or any other chrome, wrap it in a `<div>` you own:

```tsx
<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', borderRadius: 10, overflow: 'hidden' }}>
  <div style={{ padding: 6, backgroundColor: '#ffffff09' }}>
    <text style={{ fontSize: 12, color: '#a3a3a3' }}>{language}</text>
  </div>
  <code code={source} language={language} style={{ padding: 12, minWidth: 0 }} />
</div>
```

`<markdown>` is different: it keeps its own fenced-block card, because a document
renderer owns its layout. Tune that card with the `mdCode*` metrics.

### `<diff>`

A unified diff viewer. It **flows** with its parent by default, so a parent
list can be the only scroller. Collapsing a file removes its rows rather than hiding
them, so a collapsed 10k-line file costs one row.

Use `maxLines` to keep a long patch short. Show more fires `onShowMore`. Clear
`maxLines` in that handler to reveal the rest.

Pass `scroll` and a **bounded height** only for a dedicated full-window viewer.
That path uses GPUI's `list()` and virtualizes. Do not nest it inside another
scroller. See [Scrolling](#scrolling).

```tsx
<diff
  patch={unifiedPatch}
  wordDiff                     // highlight only the tokens that changed
  maxLines={open ? undefined : 24}
  collapsedPaths={['pnpm-lock.yaml']}
  onShowMore={() => setOpen(true)}
  onToggleFile={(e) => toggle(e.value)}
  onLineClick={(e) => console.log(e.oldLine, e.newLine, e.value)}
/>
```

![A unified diff with word-level highlights](./docs/images/diff.png)

### `<markdown>`

GitHub-flavoured markdown: headings, lists, tables, block quotes, fenced code,
strikethrough, task lists, and autolinked bare URLs.

```tsx
<markdown source={readme} onLinkClick={(e) => open(e.value)} />
```

![Markdown with headings, lists, a table and a code fence](./docs/images/markdown.png)

### Theming

All three take the same optional `theme` prop. Every field layers on top of the
built-in dark theme, so overriding one token leaves the rest alone.

```tsx
<code
  code={source}
  language="rust"
  theme={{
    appearance: 'dark',        // or 'light'
    accent: '#7c86ff',
    syntax: { keyword: '#f38ba8', string: '#a6e3a1' },
  }}
/>
```

**Layout numbers live in the theme too**, under `metrics`. Row heights, gutter
widths, paddings and the heading scale are props, not Rust constants, so tuning
the design is a React re-render and never a native rebuild.

```tsx
<diff
  patch={patch}
  theme={{
    metrics: {
      diffLineHeight: 26,
      diffGutterWidth: 48,
      mdHeadingSizes: [24, 19, 16, 14],
    },
  }}
/>
```

When `scroll` is on, `<diff>` virtualizes from these numbers without measuring,
so changing `diffLineHeight` also re-sizes the scroll model.

The same three components, retuned entirely from `metrics` with no rebuild:

![The components with enlarged metrics](./docs/images/metrics.png)

## WebGPU and Three.js

Desktop GPUIX exposes a **minimal Three.js WebGPU subset** through
`@gpuix/react/webgpu`. `installWebGpu()` sets `navigator.gpu`.
`createGPUCanvas()` is the swap surface Three.js needs.

```tsx
import { render } from '@gpuix/react'
import { createGPUCanvas, installWebGpu } from '@gpuix/react/webgpu'
import { WebGPURenderer } from 'three/webgpu'

installWebGpu()
const canvas = createGPUCanvas(640, 480)
const renderer = new WebGPURenderer({ canvas, antialias: false })
await renderer.init()

render(<canvas source={canvas.id} style={{ width: 640, height: 480 }} />)
// Keep `canvas` alive and call canvas.destroy() when the view unmounts.
```

Present currently copies pixels through `paint_image` on every OS. The WebGPU
device is a separate wgpu instance from the window, so Linux cannot sample the
canvas texture in-scene yet. Untextured materials, vertex and index buffers, uniforms, and a depth buffer
work. MSAA (`antialias: true`), cube maps, stencil, `writeTexture`,
`copyTextureToBuffer`, render bundles, and query sets are not implemented.

Run the cube example:

```bash
cd examples && bun --hot three-webgpu.tsx
```

## Images and icons

`<img>` takes a **filesystem path or data URL**. Resolve local files with
`fileURLToPath` or `path.join`, or encode in-memory bytes as base64.

### `<img>`

`<img>` paints through GPUI's image element. It loads **PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF,
SVG, BMP, TIFF, ICO, and Netpbm** from disk or data URLs. SVG here is a
full-colour image, not a tintable icon.

```tsx
<img
  src={fileURLToPath(new URL('./photo.png', import.meta.url))}
  objectFit="cover"
  style={{ width: 240, height: 140, borderRadius: 12 }}
/>
```

```tsx
const src = `data:image/png;base64,${Buffer.from(pngBytes).toString('base64')}`

<img src={src} style={{ width: 240, height: 140 }} />
```

Data URLs support every image format listed above. Base64 and percent-encoded
payloads are accepted.

`objectFit` matches CSS: `"contain"` (default), `"cover"`, `"fill"`,
`"scaleDown"`, or `"none"`. An empty `src` or a failed load shows a fallback
placeholder instead of crashing.

### `<svg>`

`<svg>` uses GPUI's **monochrome icon renderer**. Raw `source` works on desktop
and in the browser. Desktop apps can also use a local `src` path. The icon is
drawn as one shape and tinted with `style.color`.

For application icons, prefer **raw SVG source**. It works with both GPUIX
targets and lets a bundler embed each icon in the JavaScript bundle. Use `src`
only for a desktop app that intentionally ships loose asset files.

`src` is a filesystem path **or** a `data:image/svg+xml,…` URL. Vitest and some
Bun `import … with { type: 'file' }` bindings emit the data URL. GPUIX decodes
both.

`style.color` is required. Without it the icon does not paint. Prefer
`fill="#000"` or `stroke="#000"` in the file. `currentColor` in the SVG is not
the same as `style.color`.

#### Bun

Use Bun's [`text` loader](https://bun.sh/docs/bundler/loaders#text). The import
is a string containing the complete SVG, and `bun build` embeds it in the
bundle.

```tsx
import searchSvg from './assets/icons/search.svg' with { type: 'text' }

<svg
  source={searchSvg}
  style={{ width: 16, height: 16, color: '#b4b4b4' }}
/>
```

The chat example builds every sidebar and composer icon from raw SVG source this
way.

#### Node.js

For supported Node.js releases, read the icon once relative to the module. A
`URL` keeps the path correct across operating systems and avoids `__dirname`.

```tsx
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs'

const searchSvg = readFileSync(
  new URL('./assets/icons/search.svg', import.meta.url),
  'utf8',
)

<svg
  source={searchSvg}
  style={{ width: 16, height: 16, color: '#b4b4b4' }}
/>
```

Node.js also has [text modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#text-modules),
but they currently require `--experimental-import-text`. Prefer
[`readFileSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fsreadfilesyncpath-options) until
text imports no longer need a runtime flag.

## Supported Events

| Event | Props | Payload fields |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Click | `onClick` | `x`, `y`, `button`, `clickCount`, `isRightClick`, `modifiers` — primary button only |
| Aux click | `onAuxClick` | `x`, `y`, `clickCount`, `isRightClick`, `modifiers` — non-primary buttons |
| Mouse down | `onMouseDown` | `x`, `y`, `button`, `clickCount`, `modifiers` |
| Mouse up | `onMouseUp` | `x`, `y`, `button`, `clickCount`, `modifiers` |
| Mouse enter | `onMouseEnter` | `hovered` |
| Mouse leave | `onMouseLeave` | `hovered` |
| Mouse move | `onMouseMove` | `x`, `y`, `pressedButton`, `modifiers` |
| Click outside | `onMouseDownOutside` | `x`, `y`, `button`, `modifiers` |
| Key down | `onKeyDown` | `key`, `keyChar`, `isHeld`, `modifiers` |
| Key up | `onKeyUp` | `key`, `keyChar`, `modifiers` |
| Focus | `onFocus` | — |
| Blur | `onBlur` | — |
| Scroll | `onScroll` | `deltaX`, `deltaY`, `precise`, `touchPhase`, `modifiers` |
| Change | `onChange` | `value` — `<input>` and `<textarea>` only |
| Submit | `onSubmit` | `value` — `<input>` and `<textarea>` only |
| Toggle file | `onToggleFile` | `value` (file path) — `<diff>` only |
| Show more | `onShowMore` | `value` (hidden line count) — `<diff>` only |
| Line click | `onLineClick` | `value`, `oldLine`, `newLine` — `<diff>` only |
| Link click | `onLinkClick` | `value` (URL) — `<markdown>` only |

Keyboard and focus listeners create a persistent GPUI `FocusHandle`
automatically. A listener alone does not put a `div` in the Tab order; add
`tabIndex={0}` for that. Inputs and textareas already use tab index `0`.

A node that listens for both `onMouseDown` and `onMouseMove` **captures the
pointer**, like HTML [`setPointerCapture`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setPointerCapture).
`onMouseMove` and `onMouseUp` keep firing after the pointer leaves the hitbox,
leaves the parent, and leaves the window. A node with only `onMouseDown` /
`onMouseUp` does not capture, so a click still ends if you release outside.

Capture is armed by the **press itself**, so put all three listeners on the
element the user grabs:

```tsx
<div
  style={{ cursor: 'grab', active: { cursor: 'grabbing' } }}
  onMouseDown={(e) => beginDrag(e)}
  onMouseMove={(e) => moveDrag(e)}
  onMouseUp={endDrag}
/>
```

A full-window overlay mounted on the press cannot replace this. The overlay does
not exist yet when the press happens, so it never arms capture, and a release
past the window edge is lost. Only the pressed element receives moves while the
gesture runs, and only the hovered element receives them otherwise, so the cost
is one event per pointer move.

Capture arms on the **left** button only. A right-button drag is not captured,
so it ends when the pointer leaves the element.

`onClick` fires on primary-button mouse-up. Use **`onAuxClick`** for the others,
and read `event.isRightClick`. `onMouseDown` and `onMouseUp` see every
button through `event.button` (`0` left, `1` middle, `2` right).

## Supported Styles

CSS-like styling via the `style` prop:

```tsx
<div style={{
  display: 'flex',
  flexDirection: 'column',
  gap: 8,
  padding: 16,
  backgroundColor: '#3b82f6',
  borderRadius: 8,
}}>
  <div style={{ color: '#ffffff', fontSize: 18 }}>
    Hello GPUI!
  </div>
</div>
```

**Layout:** `display` (`"flex"` | `"grid"`), `flexDirection`, `flexWrap`, `flexGrow`, `flexShrink`, `flexBasis`, `alignItems`, `alignSelf`, `alignContent`, `justifyContent`, `gap`, `rowGap`, `columnGap`, `gridTemplateColumns`, `gridTemplateRows`, `gridColumnMin`, `gridRowMin`

**Sizing:** `width`, `height`, `minWidth`, `minHeight`, `maxWidth`, `maxHeight` — accepts pixels (number) or percentages (string like `"100%"`)

**Spacing:** `padding`, `paddingTop/Right/Bottom/Left`, `margin`, `marginTop/Right/Bottom/Left`

**Position:** `position` (`"relative"` | `"absolute"` | `"fixed"`), `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` — `"fixed"` lays out like `"absolute"`, because GPUI has no scrolling document to be fixed against

**Visual:** `background`, `backgroundColor`, `color`, `opacity`, `cursor`, `pointerEvents`, `borderRadius`, `borderTopLeftRadius`, `borderTopRightRadius`, `borderBottomLeftRadius`, `borderBottomRightRadius`, `borderWidth`, `borderTopWidth`, `borderRightWidth`, `borderBottomWidth`, `borderLeftWidth`, `borderColor`, `boxShadow`

### Cursors

`cursor` takes the CSS keyword. An unlisted keyword is ignored, like any other
invalid style value.

| Group | Keywords |
|---|---|
| Pointing | `default`, `auto`, `pointer`, `context-menu`, `not-allowed`, `no-drop` |
| Text | `text`, `vertical-text`, `crosshair` |
| Dragging | `grab`, `grabbing`, `move`, `all-scroll`, `alias`, `copy` |
| Resizing | `col-resize`, `row-resize`, `ew-resize`, `ns-resize`, `nwse-resize`, `nesw-resize`, `n-resize`, `e-resize`, `s-resize`, `w-resize`, `ne-resize`, `nw-resize`, `se-resize`, `sw-resize` |

```tsx
<div style={{ cursor: 'grab', active: { cursor: 'grabbing' } }} />
<div style={{ cursor: 'col-resize' }} />
```

### Colors

Every color-bearing style field accepts the same string grammar. GPUIX native
uses `csscolorparser` 0.8.3 and accepts:

- named colors and `transparent`;
- 3/4/6/8-digit hex, with or without `#`;
- `rgb()` / `rgba()`, `hsl()` / `hsla()`, `hwb()` / `hwba()`, and
  `hsv()` / `hsva()`;
- `lab()`, `lch()`, `oklab()`, and `oklch()`;
- `none` components and the parser's limited relative-color `from` / `calc()`
  forms.

Standard comma and modern space/slash alpha forms work. Values are converted
to hard-clipped sRGB before GPUI paints them. Invalid strings are ignored for
that property; they do not reject the full style object.

### Linear gradients

`background` accepts GPUI's native **two-stop linear gradient**. Angles follow
CSS: `0` points up and values increase clockwise. Stop positions use `0` to `1`.

```tsx
<div
  style={{
    background: {
      type: 'linear-gradient',
      angle: 90,
      stops: [
        { color: '#7c3aed', position: 0 },
        { color: '#06b6d4', position: 1 },
      ],
      colorSpace: 'oklab',
    },
    borderRadius: 12,
  }}
/>
```

`colorSpace` is optional and defaults to `"srgb"`. GPUI also supports
`"oklab"`. It does not support radial, conic, repeating, or gradients with
more than two stops.

`hsv()`, `hsva()`, and `hwba()` are parser extensions rather than CSS Color 4
standard functions. `color()`, platform/dynamic colors, and numeric color
integers are not accepted.

Theme values can use the same modern grammar:

```tsx
const theme = {
  surface: 'oklch(18% 0.02 260)',
  accent: 'oklch(67.3% 0.182 276.935)',
  text: 'oklch(96% 0 0)',
}

<div style={{ backgroundColor: theme.surface, borderColor: theme.accent }}>
  <text style={{ color: theme.text }}>Hello GPUIX!</text>
</div>
```

Limited relative-color forms can derive a new color from a base value:

```tsx
<div
  style={{
    backgroundColor: '#bad455',
    borderColor: 'oklch(from #bad455 calc(l - 0.15) calc(c * 0.7) h)',
  }}
/>
```

`boxShadow` accepts one structured shadow. Its fields are `offsetX`, `offsetY`,
`blurRadius`, `spreadRadius`, and `color`:

```tsx
<div
  style={{
    boxShadow: {
      offsetX: 0,
      offsetY: 4,
      blurRadius: 12,
      spreadRadius: 0,
      color: '#00000033',
    },
  }}
/>
```

**Overflow:** `overflow`, `overflowX`, `overflowY` — `"hidden"` clips content, `"scroll"` creates a native scrollable container with persistent scroll state

**Text:** `fontSize`, `fontFamily`, `fontWeight`, `textAlign`, `lineHeight`, `whiteSpace`, `textOverflow`, `lineClamp`

**Selection:** `userSelect` (`"text"` | `"none"`), `selectionColor` — both inherit down the tree

### Hover and active

`hover` and `active` are **nested style objects**. GPUI applies them natively
when the pointer is over the element or the mouse is down. There is no
JavaScript round trip.

```tsx
<div
  style={{
    backgroundColor: '#313244',
    borderRadius: 8,
    padding: 12,
    hover: { backgroundColor: '#45475a' },
    active: { backgroundColor: '#585b70' },
  }}
>
  Press
</div>
```

Nesting is one level deep. A `hover` object cannot contain another `hover` or
`active`.

They work on **every** element, including `<text>`, `<code>`, `<markdown>`,
`<diff>`, `<img>`, `<svg>` and the editors. The one exception is
`<virtual-list>`, whose `style` type rejects them: gpui's list has no
interactive identity to hold a hovered or pressed state, so put them on a
wrapping `<div>`.

> **Note: `white-space: pre` is not supported.** GPUI's text system only has `normal` (wraps) and `nowrap` (single line). To preserve newlines like HTML `<pre>`, split your text on `\n` in React and render each line as a separate `<text>` element in a flex column:
>
> ```tsx
> <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', fontFamily: 'Menlo' }}>
>   {code.split('\n').map((line, i) => (
>     <text key={i} style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>{line}</text>
>   ))}
> </div>
> ```

> **Note: GPUI defaults text color to black, not white.** Unlike CSS, GPUI does not inherit `color` from parent elements. Every `<text>` element that doesn't set an explicit `color` style will render as black — invisible on dark backgrounds. Always set `color` on your text elements or on a parent `<div>` (which applies `text_color` to all children in that subtree via GPUI's `Styled` trait).

## Automation

Mark elements with **`testId`**, then drive them like Playwright. The same
client works in vitest, inside browser pages, and against a child process.
Mouse actions use the normal GPUI input path in all three hosts.

```tsx
<div testId="sidebar-collapse" onClick={onCollapse}>‹</div>
<textarea testId="composer" value={draft} onChange={...} />
<div testId="send" onClick={onSend}>↑</div>
```

```ts
import { createTestRoot } from '@gpuix/react'
import { connectTest } from '@gpuix/react/automation'
import { ChatApp } from './chat'

const { render, renderer } = createTestRoot()
render(<ChatApp />)
const app = await connectTest(renderer)

await app.screenshot({ path: 'open.png' })

await app.clock.pause()
await app.getByTestId('sidebar-collapse').click()
await app.clock.fastForward(200)
await app.screenshot({ path: 'collapsed.png' })

await app.getByTestId('composer').fill('hello gpuix')
await app.getByTestId('send').click()
await app.screenshot({ path: 'sent.png' })
```

That is the chat example. The real test lives in
[`examples/chat.test.tsx`](https://github.com/remorses/gpuix/blob/main/examples/chat.test.tsx).

```
createTestRoot()          browser render()          launch({ command, args })
       │                         │                              │
       ▼                         ▼                              ▼
connectTest(renderer)      globalThis.gpuix                child stdin / stdout
       │                         │                              │
       └─────────────────────────┴──► App / Locator ◄───────────┘
                                  click, fill, query, clock
```

### Browser apps

Every browser render installs the automation `App` as **`globalThis.gpuix`**.
It is always available after `render()` returns. No setup flag or separate
transport is required.

```ts
await page.evaluate(async () => {
  await globalThis.gpuix
    .getByTestId('sidebar-collapse')
    .click()

  await globalThis.gpuix
    .getByTestId('composer')
    .fill('hello from Playwriter')

  await globalThis.gpuix.clock.pause()
  await globalThis.gpuix.clock.fastForward(200)
})
```

The browser global supports locators, input, tree and text queries, bounds,
selection, scrolling, focus, and clock control. Browser pages cannot write an
arbitrary local screenshot path. Use the controlling browser tool for that:

```ts
await page.screenshot({ path: 'review/chat.png', scale: 'css' })
```

Bounds come back in **canvas pixels**, not CSS pixels, because that is the
coordinate space GPUI lays out in. On a 2x display a locator at `x: 44` sits at
CSS `x: 22`. Convert before handing a rectangle to a browser tool:

```ts
const scale = await page.evaluate(() => {
  const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas')!
  return canvas.width / canvas.clientWidth
})
const { bounds } = await page.evaluate(() =>
  globalThis.gpuix.getByText('New Task').waitFor(),
)
await page.screenshot({
  scale: 'css',
  clip: {
    x: bounds.x / scale,
    y: bounds.y / scale,
    width: bounds.width / scale,
    height: bounds.height / scale,
  },
})
```

Do not read `window.devicePixelRatio` for this. An automation tool can override
the viewport scale factor after GPUI has already sized its canvas, and then the
two disagree.

### Locators

| Call | Matches |
|---|---|
| `app.getByTestId('send')` | The `testId` prop |
| `app.getByText('New chat')` | A node's own text |
| `app.getByType('textarea')` | The host element type |
| `locator.getByText('...')` | A descendant of another locator |

`click()` hits the center of the last painted bounds. `fill(text)` replaces the
focused editor contents. `press('enter')` sends one key. `waitFor()` polls until
exactly one match exists. `textContent()` returns the node's own text plus every
descendant's, like DOM `textContent`.

### Mouse, wheel, and drag

| Call | What it does |
|---|---|
| `locator.hover()` | Moves the pointer to the center, so hover styles and tooltips fire |
| `locator.wheel(dx, dy)` | One wheel event over the center |
| `locator.dragBy(dx, dy)` | Presses on the center, travels, releases |
| `locator.dragTo(target)` | Same, ending on another locator or a `{ x, y }` point |
| `app.mouse.move / down / up / click` | Raw pointer input in window coordinates |
| `app.mouse.wheel(target, dx, dy)` | A wheel over a point or a locator |
| `app.mouse.drag(from, to)` | A drag between two points, two locators, or a mix |

A drag sends **interpolated moves**, not one jump, because snapping, live
previews, and per-move commits only appear when the pointer travels. Pass
`steps` to control how many, and `offset` to press away from the center.

```ts
await app.getByTestId('clip-7').dragBy(120, 0, { steps: 6 })
await app.getByTestId('clip-7-trim-end').dragTo(app.getByTestId('clip-8'))
await app.mouse.drag({ x: 240, y: 500 }, { x: 700, y: 620 })
```

Every mouse call takes **`modifiers`** in the same syntax as `press('cmd-a')`,
so cmd-wheel zoom, shift-click range selection, and alt-drag duplication are all
testable:

```ts
await app.getByTestId('canvas').wheel(0, 120, { modifiers: 'cmd' })
await app.getByTestId('clip-8').click({ modifiers: 'shift' })
```

`click()` needs painted bounds. **Every element that accepts `testId` records
them**, including `<img>`, `<svg>` and `<anchored>`. An `<anchored>` reports the
box of the overlay itself, not of the trigger it is anchored to, so `click()`
lands on the menu even when it is deferred and snapped back inside the window.

`<virtual-list>` is the exception, and it takes no `testId`. gpui's list is not
an interactive element, so it has nothing to record a box against. Put the
locator on a wrapping `<div>`.

### Screenshots and clock

`app.screenshot({ path })` writes the current GPU frame as a PNG.

`app.clock.pause()`, `set(ms)`, and `fastForward(ms)` freeze native motion time.
Use that to capture a sidebar animation at known timestamps:

```ts
const startedAt = await app.clock.pause()
await app.getByTestId('sidebar-collapse').click()
await app.captureFrames('review/sidebar', [
  startedAt,
  startedAt + 100,
  startedAt + 200,
])
```

### Live apps

`launch({ command, args })` starts the app and speaks the same commands
over stdin as SSE `data:` lines. The app listens only when stdin is a **pipe**,
so a normal terminal run is unchanged. Lines without a `data:` prefix are
ignored; `console.log` cannot break a message.

```ts
import { launch } from '@gpuix/react/automation'

const app = await launch({
  command: 'bun',
  args: ['examples/chat.tsx'],
  env: { GPUIX_BACKGROUND: '1' },
})
await app.getByTestId('composer').fill('hello')
await app.getByTestId('composer').press('enter')
await app.getByText('hello').waitFor()
await app.screenshot({ path: 'live.png' })
await app.close()
```

Every live-app check must set `GPUIX_BACKGROUND=1`, and the app entry must map
that flag to `focus: false`. On macOS and Windows, automation uses the real
window input and paint pipelines without making the window active, so taking
the user's keyboard has no test benefit. Linux currently ignores `focus`.

`fill()` and `press()` dispatch through the live GPUI window input pipeline, so
native `<input>` and `<textarea>` elements receive GPUI's keyboard and IME
handling instead of a test-only input path.

## Testing

The locators above sit on a **GPU-backed test renderer** (`TestGpuixRenderer`).
It runs the same `GpuixView`, `build_element()`, `apply_styles()`, and event
handlers as production. Test windows are positioned offscreen and rendered by
Metal on macOS or DirectX on Windows. The methods below are the lower-level API
when a locator is not enough.

| Platform | Test renderer | PNG capture |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | Metal | Yes |
| Windows | DirectX | Yes |
| Linux | Not yet | Waiting for GPUI's wgpu headless renderer |

```ts
import { createTestRoot } from '@gpuix/react/testing'

const { root, renderer } = createTestRoot()

root.render(<MyComponent />)
renderer.flush()  // triggers GpuixView::render() on the native GPU

// Simulate events through GPUI's native input pipeline
renderer.nativeSimulateClick(50, 50)
renderer.nativeSimulateKeystrokes('enter')

// Inspect results
const events = renderer.drainNativeEvents()
renderer.captureScreenshot('/tmp/test.png')
const text = renderer.getAllText()
```

### Testing native elements

`getAllText()` only sees `<text>` nodes in the retained tree. `<code>`, `<diff>`
and `<markdown>` paint their text inside GPUI, so use `getPaintedText()`, which
returns every string painted in the last frame in paint order:

```ts
root.render(<code code={'a\nb'} language="ts" />)
expect(renderer.getPaintedText()).toEqual(['a', 'b'])
```

Selection has its own helper. Listeners are registered during **paint**, so
`dragSelect` flushes between every step; calling `simulateMouseDown` / `Move` /
`Up` by hand without those flushes selects nothing:

```ts
expect(renderer.dragSelect(20, 30, 900, 300)).toBe('first line\nsecond line')
```

A highlight is a **quad**, so no amount of `getPaintedText()` will show it. Use
`getPaintedHighlights()`, which reports the matched range in UTF-16 units plus
the boxes it actually drew, one per visual row:

```ts
root.render(
  <div highlight={{ query: 'quick' }}>
    <text>the quick brown fox</text>
  </div>,
)
const [hit] = renderer.getPaintedHighlights()
expect(hit.text.slice(hit.start, hit.end)).toBe('quick')
expect(hit.rects).toHaveLength(1)
```

### Assert numbers, not pixels

For a stateful surface, paint the state you want to assert into a **readout**
element and read it with `textContent()`. A screenshot tells you that something
changed; a readout tells you what, and the failure message names the number.

```tsx
<text testId="readout">{`x=${scrollX} y=${scrollY} zoom=${zoom} sel=${selected}`}</text>
```

```ts
const readout = await app.getByTestId('readout').textContent()
expect(readout).toBe('x=140 y=60 zoom=24 sel=clip-7')
```

Every test in [`examples/timeline.test.tsx`](./examples/timeline.test.tsx) works
this way, including the drag, trim, snap, and zoom gestures. Keep the screenshot
as well, for a human to look at after the run.

Screenshots land in `packages/react/screenshots/` and `examples/screenshots/`,
both gitignored, so they can be inspected after a run without adding a binary
diff to every commit. The curated set the README links to lives in
`docs/images/` and is regenerated with:

```bash
bun scripts/screenshots.ts
```

## Developing the Rust side

JS remount is covered above. There is **no hot reload for the native half**,
and there cannot be: `require()` of a `.node` file calls `process.dlopen`, Node
has no matching unload, and the live state (GPUI's platform, GPU device, open
window, UI thread, and selection registry) stays inside the loaded library. A
second load would create independent native state while the first library
remains loaded.

The rebuild is fast enough that it does not matter. Measured on an M-series Mac
after touching one file:

| Step | Time |
|---|---|
| `cargo check --lib` | 1.5s |
| `cargo build --lib` | 4.9s |
| `bun run build:debug` (napi) | ~2s |
| One vitest screenshot file | ~2s |

`bun run dev` wires that into a loop: it watches `packages/native/src`,
rebuilds, and re-renders the screenshot tests. **Rust edit to fresh PNGs is
about 4 seconds.**

```bash
bun run dev                      # rebuild, re-render the showcase screenshots
bun scripts/dev.ts --shots diff  # only tests matching "diff"
bun scripts/dev.ts --app native-text   # rebuild, restart an example app
```

Screenshot mode is the better default. Open
`packages/react/screenshots/showcase.png` in Preview.app, which reloads on
write, and unlike a live window the PNG can also be read by an agent.

Two things avoid the rebuild entirely:

- **Content** already lives in props. Change `patch` or `source` and the next
  frame shows it.
- **Design numbers** live in `theme.metrics`. Tuning a row height or heading
  scale is a React re-render.

The test renderer uses `VisualTestAppContext` with a `TestDispatcher` for deterministic scheduling. Event simulation goes through GPUI's coordinate-based hit testing and dispatch — not synthetic JS events.
